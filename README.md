# **LOKI** 
### was summoned by raja (aka 'ItWasAlienz')

### Installation instructions:
1) from within maiden/matron's REPL type:
   
        ;install https://github.com/ItWasAlienz/loki
   
3) loki comes with audio files which you'll need to move to your norns's 'audio' folder. 
after completing the previously mentioned `install` directive(watch the 'matron' terminal readout for when it says 'installed "loki"!'), you can then move these files to the appropriate 'audio' folder by typing the following into maiden/matron's REPL:
  
        os.execute('mv '.._path.code.."loki/lokiaud ".._path.audio)

after doing this, the REPL should display "true	exit	0" to indicate success, and 'lokiaud' folder will then be located within your norns 'audio' folder(if installing from a web-browser, you may need to refresh to see the change). You can then start the app and begin playing ðŸ”Š ðŸ¥°
