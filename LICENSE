This is a modified version of <https://unlicense.org> where i, Raja, have
removed the language "detriment to heirs" because it's a silly
western-"civilization" way in which software devs try to create more melodrama
over a sense of 'sacrifice' then there actually is: you cannot segregate my 'heirs'
out from the 'public-at-large', therefore, my 'heirs' would neither suffer nor benefit,
deliberately in any way as they are accorded the same rights as any others
who are members of the public-at-large. The wording of the unlicense there tells me
there was a specific race and only that race involved in this wording.
BECAUSE MOST OF ALL: NOT EVERYTHING THAT DOESN'T MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE FINANCIAL GAIN 
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A 'DETRIMENT'(I mean, c'mon now, you lighter-skinned ignoramuses!)
Software developers are simply robots who program other robots, i don't need to honor their 
fake-ass sense of 'philanthropy' here if it doesn't honor my and my heirs' humanity.
